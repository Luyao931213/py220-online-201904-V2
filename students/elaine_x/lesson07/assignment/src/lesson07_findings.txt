Modified the code form lesson05, it now returns a tuple for customer and a tuple
for products. Each tuple contains 4 values: (the number of records processed (int),
the record count in the database prior to running (int), the record count after
running (int), and the time taken to run the module (float).


Using time, my linear.py takes about 4.5 sec to import customer or product into database.
Using threading in my parallel.py, the run time is reduced to about 0.3 sec.
