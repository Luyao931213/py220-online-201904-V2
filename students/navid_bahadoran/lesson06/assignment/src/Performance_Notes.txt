Issues with poor_perf.py
1- It reads csv files twice for a 1,000,000 entry
Solution: Just one iteration is enough

2- It creates list of each line of csv file
Solution: no need to a list of each line, the open command make a iterable object
that we can iterate over for each line.

3- It uses if for each year to check. Code check one line for each year,.
Solution: instead we can use elif, because when the year is 2012, definitely
it cannot be any other years.
