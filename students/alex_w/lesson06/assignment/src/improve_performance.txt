My approach was to increase the efficiency of looping through the rows
of data, especially after populating to a million lines. In the original
poor_perf file, there is a second open with context statement which
repeats looping through the rows looking for "ao." Just combine that
with context as an if condition to speed up time. Also, changed several if conditions under the analyze function scope to elif/else statements.
After improvements comparing original function analyze runtime
is 15.02 secs. Whereas improved function analyze_v2 runtime is 6.54
faster.
