Linear performance was by far the worst performer, with run times of 0.734375 & 0.921875

Materially increase peformance was achieved via threading & queueing. Performance times were:

Thread:
0.125 & 0.1875

Queue:
0.140625 & 0.203125

Thread runs achieved an 80% reduction in processing time, and Queue runs resulted in a 78% reduction
in processing time.

Based on the result above we would recommend adopting multi-processing into our development process.
