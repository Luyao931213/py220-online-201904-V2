# Typo in original file.

In poor_perf.py there's a typo on lines 39-40:

if new[0][6:] == '2018':
    year_count['2017'] += 1

Changing it to:

if new[0][6:] == '2018':
    year_count['2018'] += 1

# Added a print statement to get a better handle on what's happening.

Unfortunately, the method I used for creating my csv is a little big to put
here, it will be attached in my pull request however as csv_generator.py
